The release of 5.0 is only a few weeks away bringing with it major changes
including replacement of the current Esmond data archive with Opensearch (an
Apache licensed derivative of Elasticsearch). This talk will cover what you need
to do to prepare including how to test with the latest beta version, highlight
potential breaking changes and the impact on historical data. We'll also
highlight what to expect post-5.0 in terms of additional features and OS
support.

This talk should be of interest to anyone currently running a perfSONAR
host or looking to start using it.

Please plan to join us in one of the 2 following sessions on Friday March 31st:
 - at 11:00 CEST (UTC+2) for a [GÃ‰ANT hosted InfoShare](https://events.geant.org/event/1401/), [watch the recording](https://youtu.be/Tc9j3rcEySc).
 - at 14:00 EDT (UTC-4) for a [ESnet hosted CI Engineering Lunch & Learn](https://www.es.net/science-engagement/ci-engineering-lunch-and-learn-series/), [watch the recording](https://youtu.be/sWJXpMIAKZI).

We will also reserve time for questions and will welcome your feedback.

We look forward to seeing you on March 31st.
