The Fourth European perfSONAR User Workshop will bring together perfSONAR
user and developer communities to explore use cases for the toolkit, to
share best practices, and to discuss future features and the perfSONAR
development roadmap.

We’re calling for proposals to present during the workshop. If you have
a use case, a deployment story, some feature requests to share or even
a demo or some training material and you’re willing to present it and
discuss it with the community, we’re welcoming your contribution.

More information and preliminary registration is already available
for the 4th European [perfSONAR Users
Workshop](https://events.geant.org/event/1626/)
on May 14, 15 and 16 in Trondheim, Norway.


The Workshop is being organised by the [GÉANT GN5.1 project](https://geant.org/gn5-1/),
Work Package 6 "[Network Development](https://wiki.geant.org/display/NETDEV/NETDEV+Home)",
including the perfSONAR development team within Task 3.
