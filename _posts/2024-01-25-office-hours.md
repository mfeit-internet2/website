In the wake of TLPW Perf Club coming to a close, the perfSONAR team
has decided to try out a similar open forum for current and
prospective users to discuss perfSONAR-related topics.  We’re calling
it perfSONAR Office Hours and plan to host it once per quarter as part
of the ESNet CI Lunch and Learn series.  Topics could include, but are
not limited to:

 * Deployment
 * Making measurements and interpreting the results
 * System tuning
 * Ideas for new features

Bug reports and security concerns should, as always, be reported
directly to the development team at
[perfsonar-developer@internet2.edu](mailto:perfsonar-developer@internet2.edu).

The first meeting will take place Friday, February 16 at 2:00 p.m. ET
and can be attended using the regular CI Lunch and Learn Zoom at
[https://esnet.zoom.us/j/804696793](https://esnet.zoom.us/j/804696793).
See the full CI Lunch and Learn series calendar at

We’re looking forward to your questions and discussion.
