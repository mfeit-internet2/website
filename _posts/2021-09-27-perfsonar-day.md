Please plan to join us for the second annual [Internet2 TechEXtra:
perfSONAR
Day](https://internet2.edu/techextra21/techextra21-schedule/perfsonar-day-2021)
on Wednesday, November 3 from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. EDT (15:00 to
20:00 CET).

The first half of this year’s program will be a look at some of the
project’s current goings-on and what’s in the pipeline for the next
major release, perfSONAR 5.0.  After a break for lunch and an open
floor for questions, the program will continue with lightning talks
and more-technical topics.

We’re currently looking for short (3-5 minutes) lightning talks about
any perfSONAR-related subject and would welcome participation from the
user community.  If you have a topic, please send a short proposal to
[perfsonar-training@internet2.edu](mailto:perfsonar-training@internet2.edu).

Registration is complimentary for Internet2 members, MoU partners, and
InCommon participants.  There is a small fee for non-members that can
be waived for any current or prospective perfSONAR user.  If you would
like to attend and are unable to register at no charge using your
existing credentials, please contact us at
[perfsonar-training@internet2.edu](mailto:perfsonar-training@internet2.edu)
to request a complimentary registration code.
