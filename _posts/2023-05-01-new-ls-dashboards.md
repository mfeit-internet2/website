The new perfSONAR public dashboard is a powerful tool, built on top of the
Lookup Service, the global directory of all perfSONAR public instances, that 
provides statistics about the public perfSONAR deployments all around the world.
It is divided in five sections where you can find general information, maps, and
specific data regarding the perfSONAR hosts and services.

You can filter and search for Communities, hostname, perfSONAR utilisation
statistics and characteristics of the various public deployments.  We welcome
your feedback [on the perfSONAR user list](https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/info/perfsonar-user).
